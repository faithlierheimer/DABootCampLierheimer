This folder contains an in-depth analysis for purchasing data from a fictional video game's transaction records. 
Topics analyzed include gendered purchasing behavior analysis, purchasing behavior based on age group, and 
an analysis of the most popular games and their total purchase volume. 

The "Resources" file contains a draft of the analysis with some faulty code, and the actual CSV data file. 

The file "HeroesOfPymoli-Final" that is outside of the Resources folder is a Jupyter notebook that contains
the purchasing analysis along with observable trends at the top. 

It's critical to click the nbviewer link at the top of the Jupyer notebook as it will not render correctly 
in Github. 

Thanks for visiting!
