A couple of notes about this work: 

1. "Stocks Analysis.bas" file contains VBA code that loops through the stocks in the original
 dataset and outputs the following: a) the ticker symbol b) the yearly change from the opening
price at the beginning of a given year to the closing price at the end of that year c)the total
stock volume of the stock. It also formats output b) to highlight positive change in green and 
negative change in red. 

2. The PNGs marked '2014DataHead', '2015DataHead', and '2016DataHead' show the first 30-ish rows
of the output of the above code. The final output summary tables are over 3,000 rows long each,
and thus screenshots showing the entire summary table are impractical. 

3. "Stocks Analysis--challenge task.bas" file contains VBA code that loops through the summary data and 
returns the stocks with the greatest % increase and greatest % decrease as well as greatest total
stock volume.

4. The PNGs marked 'Challenge Summary-2014', 'Challenge Summary-2015', and 'Challenge Summary-2016' are 
complete screenshots of the output of the code in 'Stocks Analysis--challenge task.bas'. Given that this
summary is much shorter, the entire summary table is included. 

I uploaded the original data to my github as well for posterity, it has the output of my code. Download
with caution though, the file is enormous. 

Thank you!
