This repository currently showcases various challenges I have completed while learning different data analytics languages. 

The "Kickstarter-challenge" folder shows Excel-based analysis on the success rate of different Kickstarter campaigns based on a variety of factors.

The "VBA-challenge" folder shows analysis of several million individual pieces of stock data over a three-year period. 

The "Python-challenge" folder analyzes financial data in one part, and election data in another part, wihtout using the Pandas module.
